Нужно установить питон, пип


Note: Installation requires python3.9+

If you run into an issue please check the closed issues on the github, although feel free to re-open a new issue if you find an issue that's been closed for a few months. The codebase can and does run into similar issues as it has before, because TikTok changes things up.

pip install TikTokApi /

python -m playwright install


If you would prefer a video walk through of setting up this package YouTube video just for that. (is a version out of date, installation is the same though)
